ðŸ“ƒ **[Enhancing Trading Performance Through Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09739)**  
This study integrates realâ€‘time sentiment analysis using GPTâ€‘2 and FinBERT with traditional technical indicators (like MACD, SAR, VW MACD) and timeâ€‘series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, ETS) to enhance trading strategies on the S&Pâ€¯500. The combined sentimentâ€‘driven and technical approach significantly outperforms a benchmark buyâ€‘andâ€‘hold strategyâ€”delivering the top return of ~5.77%â€”and demonstrates more adaptive performance in volatile markets.
